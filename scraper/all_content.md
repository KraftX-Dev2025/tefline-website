**‚ÄãBIOLOGICAL CAPITAL** The lion's share of all healthcare spending is directed toward managing illness, perpetuating the misconception that health is simply the absence of disease. In reality, true wellness extends far beyond the point where sickness ends. Studies repeatedly show that illness occupies only a modest slice of the overall health continuum‚Äîyet a disproportionately large bulk of bandwidth and resources are poured into it. By contrast, the vast expanse of wellness remains largely unaddressed. ‚ÄãTefline is here to fix that. Build your biological capital like your life depends on it‚Äîit truly does.**THE GENTLE NUDGE** Here is a taste of the AI model that we deploy as our members' chief motivating duo, giving them weekly pep talks for their progress (read: pat on the back or kick on the butt as the case may be). Member journeys are confidential, but our Founder & CEO is glad to stick his neck out and divulge his data. Check out this AI deep dive into one of his **[weekly check-ins](http://bit.ly/lifemed-check-in)** for a close look at him, warts and all, through the lifestyle lens and how RxLifeMed nudged him, and before long, even you, on a better life path.
